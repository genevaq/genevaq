- âš¡ Fun facts: I'm sarcastic :stuck_out_tongue:, I like spicy and sweet foods :yum: (lots of Thai cuisine works well for me), I get along well with cats :smile_cat:, and I like to listen to obscure pre-EDM electronica from the late 80s through mid 90s, *e.g.* Orbital, The Chemical Brothers, and The Prodigy :notes:
